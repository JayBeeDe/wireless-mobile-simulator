# Propagation Version 0.9 05/05/15

## DESCRIPTION
This program aims at modelizing the propagation of 
waves from one source. It represents the power 
received from the source in each point of the defined
area.
The source can transmit with a directivity and power
depending on the angle. Several obstacles can be set 
in the area with different kinds of losses depending
on the refracted angle.
The received power depends on the distance from the
source, but also on the angle from the source and the
intersections and angles of the obstacles.

## LICENSE
This program is under MIT License (MIT). Nevertheless,
the Matlab software doesn't change anymore. Please 
refer to the LICENSE file for more information about 
the Propagation license and the web page
http://mathworks.com/pricing-licensing for further 
information about the Matlab license.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
This program is fully compatible with any operating 
system such as Microsoft® Windows®, Linux or Mac OS®
on a 32bits or 64bits architecture.
It requires Matlab version 14 (or later).
It can be executed with Matlab in the Desktop Mode 
(GUI) or in the console mode. For the console mode, we 
suggests using the Matlab console ; but it also 
possible to use other consoles such as Linux terminal.

## INSTALLATION & RUNNING
Simply extract the archive file to the Matlab working 
directory, execute the function Propagation from the
Propagation.m file. As mentionned above, you can do it
by the way of the GUI or console with the run command.
Then follow the instructions in the console.
For further information about using this program,
you can read the User's MANUAL.
